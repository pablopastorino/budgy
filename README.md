# Budgy ðŸ“‘

Personal budget app, to register incomes expenses and keep track of the balance.

## Description

The Budgy application helps to keep track of your incomes, expenses and balance. Making it easy to create and update transactions and friendly to visualize the categories sources and destinations of your money with a graphic dashboard. All this for every registrated and autenticated user.
Is developed to a challenge of Alkemy with the tecnologies of MySQL, Nodejs and React. This project is not meant to get to get to production, just to create an MVP.

## How To Run

1. `git clone https://github.com/pablopastorino/budgy.git`

2. Run the script `create-budgy-db.sql` placed into the `server` folder to set up your database.

3. Create an `.env` file into the `server` root folder and provide your database connection string (PORT and SECRET are already declared).
   Note: when running MySQL locally the connection string, typically looks like the example. And if that is the case, you only have to change the **PASSWORD** placeholder in the example.

```

# DB Connection String ("mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE")
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:PASSWORD@localhost:3306/budgy_db"

# Server Port
PORT=4000

# Secret JWT Password
SECRET=alkemy

```

The client is ready to fetch to `http://localhost:4000` host so I would recomend leaving it as the port number. If you want to change it, you must do it inside the `package.json` file in the `client` (`proxy` property) also. Feel free to change the default `SECRET`value.

4. Into the `server` folder run `npm install` or `yarn install` and `npm/yarn start` to run the server.

5. Into the `client` folder run `npm install` or `yarn install` and `npm/yarn start` to run the application.
